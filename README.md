#angular.modal
it's a very simple provider+directive to help you realize beautiful popups just like you always dreamed about.

Besides angularjs, this modal has NO dependencies. No jQuery or bootstrap. You take it and customize it.

##What it does
Right now you can interact with the system in only 1 way. 
You can create your modals like this:

    <div modalize="custom.id">
        <modalize window-class="small_size" content-class="custom-class">
            <a href="#" ng-click="$modal.open('whatever.second')">
                Start
            </a>
        </modalize>
    </div>  

    <div modalize="whatever.second">
        <modalize window-class="over_size" content-class="custom-class">
            <img src="/sample.png" width="100%">
        </modalize>
    </div>  

And configure defaults like this:

    angular.module("modalExample", ['angular.modal']);
    //
    angular.module("modalExample").config(['$modalProvider', function($modalProvider){
        $modalProvider.configSet('dom_class', 'back_overlay');
        $modalProvider.configSet('dom_active_class', 'enter');
        
        // It adds the $modal variable in the rootscope
        $modalProvider.configSet('inject_into_html', true);
    //
    }]);

##Things that will come
These are the things I will add to this module:

- [DONE]Dynamic popups. You will setup popups into the config phase and then the app will load the automatically when it needs them (and store them into the cache)
- Navigation controller and history. They are pretty the same thing. You got the point. You will be able to do $modal.back() and .forward()
- Events. They will allow you to perform specific actions in any specific moment in a popup's lifecycle.
- [DONE]Themes and layouts. You will want to customize the html generated by the modalize tag. The app will allow you to set custom templates (you will be able to switch from one to another at any time)
- Improve the way the popup is stored. (Now using IDs, use variable references instead)
